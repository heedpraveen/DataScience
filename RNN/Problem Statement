We're going to be using a recurrent neural network to model binary addition.
binary addition moves from right to left, where we try to predict the number beneath the line given the numbers above the line. 
We want the neural network to move along the binary sequences and remember when it has carried the 1 and when it hasn't, 
so that it can make the correct prediction. Don't get too caught up in the problem. The network actually doesn't care too much. 
Just recognize that we're going to have two inputs at each time step, (either a one or a zero from each number begin added). 
These two inputs will be propagated to the hidden layer, which will have to remember whether or not we carry. The prediction will 
take all of this information into account to predict the correct bit at the given position (time step).
