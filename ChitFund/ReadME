A chit fund has 25 members. Each month they contribute Rs 2000 each. End of the month, the person who bids the lowest for the corpus,
gets his bid. The group organizer gets paid a fixed commission of Rs 2500 each month (5% of 25*2000).It is deducted from the bid 
winner's corpus.  The remaining amount is distributed among all the 25 customers equally.
