In this notebook, we're going to build a convolutional neural network for recognizing handwritten digits from scratch. 
By from scratch, I mean without using tensorflow's almighty neural network functions like tf.nn.conv2d. This way, you'll 
be able to uncover the blackbox and understand how CNN works more clearly. We'll use tensorflow interactively, so you can 
check the intermediate results along the way. This will also help your understanding.

Outline
Here are some functions we will implement from scratch in this notebook.

Convolutional layer
ReLU
Max Pooling
Affine layer (Fully connected layer)
Softmax
Cross entropy error
